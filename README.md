            Request date, return date, and assigned technician.

        Notebook section for:

            IMEI details and internal notes.

            Service category and description.

        Technicians can update the service details and mark tasks as completed.

    Inventory and Invoicing:

        Track items taken from inventory for servicing.

Sample Workflow

    Service Request Creation:

        A customer submits a service request with details like service type, model, and request date.

        The system auto-fills customer details and assigns a technician.

    Technician Assignment:

        The assigned technician logs in and views the task.

        Updates the work status and adds internal notes or IMEI details.

    Inventory and Invoicing:

        The technician selects items taken from inventory for servicing.

        Once the service is completed, the system generates an invoice with a UPI QR code for payment.

    QR Code Payment:

        The customer scans the QR code on the invoice to make a payment via UPI.

        Payment details (e.g., UPI ID, amount, reference number) are embedded in the QR code.

    Completion:

        The service request is marked as "completed," and the invoice is sent to the customer.
